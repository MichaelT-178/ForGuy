            "Tip": "Code it and design it starting from the top to bottom. Add side components after you design the center. Not that a \"div\" element in HTML vertically stacks elements on the page."

            "Underlined": "Use fonts, logos, and colors to make your UI look unique, not designs",
            "Tip": "Many UI designs and components are very similar, but you probably haven't really noticed due to the different fonts, logos, and colors. For example, the YouTube subscription page and the instagram main scroll page and basically the exact same, but look completely different due to their different fonts, colors, and overall \"vibe\". Try not to make excessively weird/confusing UI designs. Try for the for the most part to use vertically stacked rectangles, squares, and circles were appropriate."

            "Underlined": "Provide \"responsive\" feedback to the user",
            "Tip": "Whenever the user hovers over something or clicks something, have the UI respond to it in someway. For example, when the user hovers over a button, change its color or make it bigger to indicate that it does something when clicked. Whenever a button is clicked always indicate through either button text changes, color changes, alerts, etc. whether the action was performed successfully or not. "

            "id": 6,
            "Underlined": "Don't use flashy colors excessively",
            "Tip": "Most popular UI's such as YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, etc. use mostly muted colors such as grey, white, and black with a small \"splash\" of colors like blue, red, purple, etc. A completely bright neon red UI probably won't look good, and a completely grey UI might come across as dull or bland. Try to find a good mixture of both, I'd say like 85-90% muted, and 10% colorful. Also try to spread the color throughout the UI and not have it all be in one place."

            "Underlined": "Collapse Horizontally stacked elements into vertically stacked elements when the screen's width decreases",
            "Tip": "For example, say you have a row of vertically aligned cards. When the user shrinks the width of the screen the cards could go underneath one another in a vertical stack."
        },
        {
            "id": 9,
            "Underlined": "Include “whitespace” in your UI",
            "Tip": "What I mean by \"whitespace\" in this context is part of the screen that contains just color and no UI components. The main benefit of this is that will help your design adapt to different screen sizes better. Since the size of the colored background isn't essential it can expand and shrink as necessary. It also helps keep your UI look \"Clean\" and not overly cluttered."
