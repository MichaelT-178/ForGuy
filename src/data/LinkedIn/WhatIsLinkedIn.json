            "Body": "To keep it simple, LinkedIn is like Instagram for jobs. It's a place where you can apply to jobs, follow companies, and create job alerts. There's also a social side to LinkedIn. You can follow your friends to see their job updates and you can create a profile of your own. Job recruiters will typically view your profile to see if you're a good candidate for a job, so try to make it nice and professional. You can also can also \"connect\" with other people and interact to with their posts, make comments, etc. I would definitely consider LinkedIn an important part of your job search and something worth checking out."
